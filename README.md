# ProjectEulerCSharp
I have a bunch of different Project Euler solutions written in a bunch of languages, mostly from the mid 2000s. Time to start over again!

Each problem is ran as its own nunit test, and displays output describing the problem and some timing results. Here is a screenshot of resharper testrunner output for one of the problems:<img width="929" alt="ProjectEulerCSharpScreenshot" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/22631908/128618307-39031ce8-1eee-41b4-922a-7bb45a8795d6.png">
